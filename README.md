Game Title: Slot Machine
This is a slot machine game that consists of 3 rows and 3 columns of numbers, with 3 repetitive numbers in a given row considered to be a jackpot. When this occurs, the jackpot row highlights green, and a message appears on the screen saying "Jackpot!".

Technologies Used: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .mp3, .jpg

Getting started:
Simply click the lever to play, then watch for the jackpot or play again response.

Icebox Items:
1. Make JavaScript code more "DRY" by coming up with a function for highlighting cells during a jackpot condition and removing the hgihlight afterwards. 
2. Shorten the .mp3 length so as to ensure it plays with every spin, regardless of how fast the button is clicked.
